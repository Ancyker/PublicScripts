Public script releases made by Ancyker. Works in here are ok to use on servers that accept donations so long as you **do not charge for access to the scripts**. That means if it requires payment/donation to access the script itself or the area the script is in you _may not use the scripts for that purpose_. If you wish to **charge** for access to the scripts provided here, please send a donation of at least $20 to sales at nymbix dot com. If you do so, all the scripts in _this repository_ will be considered licensed to your server for it's lifetime, including all additions updates. If you are not charging for access, you can send a donation anyway :)



You may modify the scripts within this repository for your own personal use. You may also modify them for a client that wishes you to do so. You may not publicly release scripts that are a derivitive work or contain any of the scripts in this repository. You may not claim any of these scripts as your own. If you add these scripts to your server you do not need to say they were obtained here, but you may not say you wrote them.
